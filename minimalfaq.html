<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: What's this ".git" folder installed?</p>
<p>A: This is the maintainer (arcticsn0w)'s git configuration. This allows him to easily push MHB to GitHub. It's nothing to be worried about, and should not take up space. This should be deleted as of 5.1.2; if it's still there, upgrade to 5.1.2!</p>
<p>Q: Where can I request features?</p>
<p>A: Email ReddestDream via Cydia.</p>
<p>Q: Where do I report installation problems?</p>
<p>A: Email arcticsn0w via Cydia.</p>
<p>Q: Why does Chrome fail to load pages?</p>
<p>A: Chrome fails to load some pages when Google Ads don't load. Use a different browser.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren't ads blocked in Twitter?</p>
<p>A: Due to the way Twitter works, we can't block ads in it.</p>
<p>Q: Does this block ads in Alien Blue?</p>
<p>A: Yes!</p>
<p>Q: Does this block ads in YouTube?</p>
<p>A: No, and it never will. For YouTube, install mikoto from the repo http://cydia.angelxwind.net.</p>
<p>Q: Why is BytaFont's Font Browser broken?</p>
<p>A: It's a bug in BytaFont that we can't fix.</p>
<p>Q: Why won't SBSettings load?</p>
<p>A: SBSettings fails to load with a particular host blocked. To fix this, please navigate to /etc/hosts in iFile and delete the line "0.0.0.0 extra.thebigboss.org". Note that this will cause ads in BigBoss to return.</p>
<p>Q: Why is loading Twitch in the web browser broken?</p>
<p>A: Google Ad issues. Loading Twitch in the Twitch app is not broken.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a toggle for this?</p>
<p>A: Yes! Use Hosts File Flipswitch and your choice of CC tweak/Activator Action.</p>
<p>Any questions about this will be immediately directed to this page.</p>
