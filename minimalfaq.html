<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: What's this ".git" folder installed?</p>
<p>A: This is the maintainer (arcticsn0w)'s git configuration. This allows him to easily push MHB to GitHub. It's nothing to be worried about, and should not take up space.</p>
<p>Q: Where can I request features?</p>
<p>A: Email ReddestDream via Cydia.</p>
<p>Q: Where do I report installation problems?</p>
<p>A: Email arcticsn0w via Cydia.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren't ads blocked in Twitter?</p>
<p>A: Due to the way Twitter works, we can't block ads in it.</p>
<p>Q: Does this block ads in Alien Blue?</p>
<p>A: Yes!</p>

<p>Q: Why is BytaFont's Font Browser broken?</p>
<p>A: It's a bug in BytaFont that we can't fix.</p>
