<h3>A minimal ad blocker!</h3>
<a href="http://arcticsn0w.github.io/repodepictions/minimalfaq.html">FAQ</a>

<p>In version 5.4:</p>
<p>Blocked GameLoft ads, e.g., Asphalt 8.</p>

<p>Reorganized the hosts file internally to save space and keep from going over 16KB.</p>

<p>Blocked Kizer ads in IPv6.</p>
<p>Blocked some more ads in Activator....-_-</p>
<p>Fixed some random ads on iDownloadBlog.</p>

<p>The above allows Minimal Hosts to continue working properly even on networks that support IPv6 (i.e., Verizon's cellular network).</p>
<p>Removed an unnecessary Google Server.</p>
<p>Eliminated two Adserver URLs that do not resolve (Dead Links).</p>
<p>Fixed the uninstallation script. Should properly uninstall now. Thanks to /u/Rustii87!</p>
