<h3>A minimal ad blocker!</h3>
<p>In this version (4.6):</p>
<p>- Changed ::1 (Loopback) to just :: (Invalid Host) for IPv6 Blocking, which should reduce discoveryd's CPU usage.</p>
<p>- Finally blocked the ads in Movie Box!</p>
<p>- Finally blocked the ads in Activator for those who don't use Twitter!</p>
<p>- Added a few more Japanese Adservers! Thanks to DurianNinja!</p>
<p>- Blocked a few additional in-app ads by request.</p>
