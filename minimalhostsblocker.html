<h3>A minimal ad blocker!</h3>
<a href="http://arcticsn0w.github.io/repodepictions/minimalfaq.html">FAQ</a>
<p>In this version:</p>
<p>Automatically deletes the .git folder.</p>
<p>Should block most ads and video ads on ABC and TheGrio.</p>
<p>In version 5.1.1:</p>
<p>Blocked a banner ad in an adblocker test for consistency.</p>
<p>Blocked a few other miscellaneous adservers on porn sites by request. :P</p>
<p>In version 5.1:</p>
<p>Blocked the video ads in the CNBC app.</p>
<p>Fixed a minor issue with Javascripts on BigBoss.</p>
<p>Blocked a few more Japanese AdServers! Thanks to /u/DurianNinja!</p>
<p>Blocked some popup ads.</p>
<p>Blocked a few other miscellaneous reported ads.</p>
<p>In version 5.0:</p>
<p>Fixed IPv6 blocking. Now, every adserver that has an IPv6 address should be blocked in both IPv4 and IPv6!</p>
<p>The above allows Minimal Hosts to continue working properly even on networks that support IPv6 (i.e., Verizon's cellular network).</p>
<p>Removed an unnecessary Google Server.</p>
<p>Eliminated two Adserver URLs that do not resolve (Dead Links).</p>
<p>Fixed the uninstallation script. Should properly uninstall now. Thanks to /u/Rustii87!</p>
